    <h2>A football games analysing tool that was created by bettors for bettors</h2>
    <p>The idea of creating this website arised following our strugle to find resources on the web that would allow to simply and quite rapidly analyse a football team or a football game and decide what the appropriate selection of bets would work for that game. Most of the time you  go online and search for football stats you would find websites that are very well equiped in terms of data but the data is not organized properly and you have to navigate multiple pages, look for multiple clues and so on. What this website is aiming to do is to offer you the chance to have in front of your eyes, with just one click, the details you need to see when analysing a football game. To see how the teams have behaved through the entire season in terms of scores, goals scored, goals received, shots, corners and so on. </p>
    <p>So when you chose one particular game to analyse all you will have to do is to select the two teams that will face each other in that game and you will have in front of you, instantly, all the games they played for the season with all the details including scoring behaviour, corners, offsides, referees etc</p>
